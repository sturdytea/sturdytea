# Hey, I'm Jasmine!
_(Better known as sturdytea)_

Nothing interesting in my past to share with at the moment. 
But I'm pretty sure it will change soon.

### I'm seeking for new job opportunities as an iOS Developer. 

I'm working hard to become better version of myself 🙇‍♀🏋️‍♀️. 
Currently working on 2 pet-projects: ARFurniture and WeatherApps. 
Wish me good luck 🍀
